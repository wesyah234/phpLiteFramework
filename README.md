# phpLiteFramework

A lightweight framework developed in PHP for creating dynamic websites and web apps. Provides clean form handling, and uses ADODB db abstraction layer for database operations. Includes template system and error logging. Moved from Sourceforge to GitHub in July 2022.

To use, just:

git clone https://github.com/wesyah234/phpLiteFramework.git

and then do:
require FRAMEWORKDIR.'/plf.inc.php';
echo plfGo(dirname(__FILE__));

that's all
