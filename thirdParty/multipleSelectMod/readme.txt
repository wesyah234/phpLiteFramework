This javascript is included whenever multiple selection lists are used.

It uses javascript to modify the behavior and appearance of multi select
list boxes, removing the need for the user to have to use the (ctrl-click)
action to select multiple items in the list.  It causes checkboxes to appear
to the left of each item, and the user can effectively check and uncheck
multiple items with single clicks.
